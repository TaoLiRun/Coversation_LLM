These are usually found in the secondary stage of the infection. Asking about this feature can help confirm or rule out Syphilis as the patient's diagnosis.\n\nIt's important to note that the patient's age and the fact that they have swelling in the left groin also suggest a possibility of an inguinal lymph node enlargement, which could be caused by various conditions such as sexually transmitted infections, including Syphilis. However, the absence of rashes on other parts of the body, as reported by the patient, reduces the likelihood of certain diagnoses such as Herpes or Chancroid.
